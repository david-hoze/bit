# This configuration uses a 'direct' cradle as a workaround for HLS/GHC issues on Windows.
# 
# THE PROBLEM:
# By default, the haskell-language-server-wrapper is "too smart": it tries to invoke 
# 'cabal' to automatically discover build flags. However, in Windows environments, 
# it often fails to pass the correct library paths to the internal GHC scripts it 
# generates, leading to "Could not load module" errors for basic packages like 
# 'directory' or 'process'.
#
# THE SOLUTION:
# We bypass the automatic discovery (the 'cabal' cradle) and explicitly tell the 
# server which packages to load. This ensures a stable environment for the IDE
# without relying on the fragile wrapper scripts.
#
# MAINTENANCE:
# If you add new dependencies to your .cabal file, you must also add them to the 
# 'arguments' list below using the "-package" flag to keep the IDE synchronized.
