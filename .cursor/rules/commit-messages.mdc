# Commit Message Suggestions

When you finish implementing a task or making changes to the codebase, provide a one-liner commit message suggestion.

## Format

Follow conventional commit style:
- **Imperative mood**: "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature"
- **Concise**: Keep under 72 characters for the subject line
- **Descriptive**: Clearly state what the commit does

## Examples

```bash
# Good commit messages
Add safe.directory config to fix git dubious ownership on USB drives
Fix memory leak in pipeline processing
Update documentation for remote configuration
Refactor device prompt validation logic
Add test for Windows USB drive initialization

# Bad commit messages
Fixed bug
Update code
Changes
WIP
```

## When to Suggest

Provide a commit message when:
- You've completed implementing a feature or fix
- You've made changes that should be committed
- The user asks for a commit message
- The task appears to be done and ready for commit

## Format for Suggestion

Present it clearly:
```
Suggested commit message:
Add feature X to handle Y scenario
```
